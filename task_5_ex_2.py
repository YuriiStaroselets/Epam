"""
Task05_2
Create function arithm_progression_product, which outputs the product of multiplying elements of arithmetic progression sequence.
The function requires 3 parameters:
1. initial element of progression - a1
2. progression step - t
3. number of elements in arithmetic progression sequence - n
Example,
For a1 = 5, t = 3, n = 4 multiplication equals to 5*8*11*14 = 6160

Note:
The output of your program should contain only the multiplication product
Usage of loops is obligatory

def arithm_progression_product(a1, t, n):
    curr_term = a1
    res = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        res *= curr_term
        curr_term = curr_term + t

    return res
